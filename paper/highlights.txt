We define the problem of scheduling prioritized workflow ensembles 
under budget and deadline constraints on IaaS cloud infrastructure.
 
We analyze and develop several dynamic (online) and static (offline) 
algorithms for task scheduling and resource provisioning that rely on workflow 
structure information  and estimates of task runtimes.
 
We evaluate these algorithms using a simulator based on 
CloudSim, which models the infrastructure and the 
application, taking into account uncertainties in task runtime estimates, 
provisioning delays, and failures.

We discuss the performance of the algorithms on a set of
synthetic workflow ensembles based on important, real scientific
applications, using a broad range of different application scenarios and
varying constraint values.
