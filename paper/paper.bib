    abstract = {The resource availability in Grids is generally unpredictable due to the autonomous and shared nature of the Grid resources and stochastic nature of the workload resulting in a best effort quality of service. The resource providers optimize for throughput and utilization whereas the users optimize for application performance. We present a cost-based model where the providers advertise resource availability to the user community. We also present a multi-objective genetic algorithm formulation for selecting the set of resources to be provisioned that optimizes the application performance while minimizing the resource costs. We use trace-based simulations to compare the application performance and cost using the provisioned and the best effort approach with a number of artificially generated workflow-structured applications and a seismic hazard application from the earthquake science community. The provisioned approach shows promising results when the resources are under high utilization and/or the applications have significant resource requirements.},

    abstract = {Cloud Computing is emerging today as a commercial infrastructure that eliminates the need for maintaining expensive computing hardware. Through the use of virtualization, clouds promise to address with the same shared set of physical resources a large user base with different needs. Thus, clouds promise to be for scientists an alternative to clusters, grids, and supercomputers. However, virtualization may induce significant performance penalties for the demanding scientific computing workloads. In this work we present an evaluation of the usefulness of the current cloud computing services for scientific computing. We analyze the performance of the Amazon {EC2} platform using micro-benchmarks and kernels. While clouds are still changing, our results indicate that the current cloud services need an order of magnitude in performance improvement to be useful to the scientific community.},

@article{Calheiros11,
    abstract = {Cloud computing is a recent advancement wherein {IT} infrastructure and applications are provided as 'services' to end-users under a usage-based payment model. It can leverage virtualized services even on the fly based on requirements (workload patterns and {QoS}) varying with time. The application services hosted under Cloud computing model have complex provisioning, composition, configuration, and deployment requirements. Evaluating the performance of Cloud provisioning policies, application workload models, and resources performance models in a repeatable manner under varying system and user configurations and requirements is difficult to achieve. To overcome this challenge, we propose {CloudSim}: an extensible simulation toolkit that enables modeling and simulation of Cloud computing systems and application provisioning environments. The {CloudSim} toolkit supports both system and behavior modeling of Cloud system components such as data centers, virtual machines ({VMs}) and resource provisioning policies. It implements generic application provisioning techniques that can be extended with ease and limited effort. Currently, it supports modeling and simulation of Cloud computing environments consisting of both single and inter-networked clouds (federation of clouds). Moreover, it exposes custom interfaces for implementing policies and provisioning techniques for allocation of {VMs} under inter-networked Cloud computing scenarios. Several researchers from organizations, such as {HP} Labs in {U.S}.A., are using {CloudSim} in their investigation on Cloud resource provisioning and energy-efficient management of data center resources. The usefulness of {CloudSim} is demonstrated by a case study involving dynamic provisioning of application services in the hybrid federated clouds environment. The result of this case study proves that the federated Cloud computing model significantly improves the application {QoS} requirements under fluctuating resource and service demand patterns.

We provide a characterization of workflows from five diverse scientific applications, describing their composition and data and computational requirements. We also describe the effect of the size of the input datasets on the structure and execution profiles of these workflows. Finally, we describe a workflow generator that produces synthetic, parameterizable workflows that closely resemble the workflows that we characterize.

abstract = {Workflow scheduling on the Grid becomes more challenging when multiple scheduling criteria are considered. Existing studies provide different approaches to the multi-criteria Grid workflow scheduling problem, and addre
ss different variants of the problem. A profound understanding of the problem’s nature can be an important step towards more generic scheduling approaches. Based on the related work and on our own experience, we propose several no
vel taxonomies of the problem, considering five facets: workflow model, scheduling criteria, scheduling process, resource model, and task model. We make a survey of the existing related work, and classify it according to the propo
sed taxonomies, identifying the most common use cases and the areas that have not been sufficiently explored yet.},

abstract = {Most algorithms developed for scheduling applications on global Grids focus on a single Quality of Service (QoS) parameter such as execution time, cost or total data transmission time. However, if we consider more than
 one QoS parameter (e.g. execution cost and time, which may be in conflict) then the problem becomes more challenging. To handle such scenarios, it is convenient to use heuristics rather than a deterministic algorithm. In this pap
er, we have proposed a workflow execution planning approach using Multiobjective Differential Evolution (MODE). Our goal was to generate a set of trade-off schedules according to two user specified QoS requirements (time and cost)
, which will offer more flexibility to users when estimating their QoS requirements. We have compared our results with a well-known baseline algorithm ‘Pareto-archived Evolutionary Strategy (PAES)’. Simulation results show that th
e modified MODE is able to find significantly better spread of compromise solutions compared with that of PAES. Copyright © 2009 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {Cloud computing environments facilitate applications by providing virtualized resources that can be provisioned dynamically. However, users are charged on a pay-per-use basis. User applications may incur large data ret
rieval and execution costs when they are scheduled taking into account only the ‘execution time’. In addition to optimizing execution time, the cost arising from data transfers between resources as well as execution costs must als
o be taken into account. In this paper, we present a particle swarm optimization (PSO) based heuristic to schedule applications to cloud resources that takes into account both computation cost and data transmission cost. We experi
ment with a workflow application by varying its computation and communication costs. We compare the cost savings when using PSO and existing ‘Best Resource Selection’ (BRS) algorithm. Our results show that PSO can achieve: a) as m
uch as 3 times cost savings as compared to BRS, and b) good distribution of workload onto resources.},
