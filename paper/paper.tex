\section{Introduction}

Workflows are important but workflow ensembles are more important, see
CyberShake or other examples.

Clouds are interesting and different from grids.

Define problems: scheduling and provisioning.


\section{Related Work}
General policy and rule-based approaches to dynamic provisioning (e.g. Amazon Auto Scaling\footnote{http://aws.amazon.com/autoscaling} and RightScale\footnote{http://www.rightscale.com}).

Policy-based approaches for scientific workloads (e.g. \cite{Marshall2010, Kim2011}). Our approach is different in that we consider workflows, while policy based approaches typically consider bags of independent tasks or unpredictable batch workloads. This enables us to take advantage of scheduling heuristics that cannot be applied to independent tasks.

Deadline-constrained cost-minimization workflow scheduling. Our work is different from \cite{Yu2005, Abrishami2010} in that we consider ensembles of workflows in IaaS clouds, which allow one to provision resources on a per-hour billing model, rather than utility grids, which allow one to choose from a pool of existing resources with a per-job billing model. Our work is different from \cite{Mao2011} in that we consider ensembles of workflows rather than unpredictable workloads containing workflows. We also have budget constraints rather than cost minimization as a goal. In other words, we assume that there is more work to be done than the available budget, so some work must be rejected. Therefore cost is not something we optimize, but rather a constraint.

Budget-constrained workflow scheduling \cite{Sakellariou2007}.

Bi-criteria scheduling and multi-criteria scheduling. These approaches are similar to ours in that we have two scheduling criteria: cost and makespan. The challenge in multi-criteria scheduling is to derive an objective function that takes into account all of the criteria. These approaches typically use metaheuristics that run for a long time before producing good results.

\section{Problem Description}
\subsection{Resource Model}
Describe the Amazon EC2 resource model. Instances are requested on-demand. Instance pricing is per-hour. Multiple VM types are available, but for this paper we focus on a single VM type because we assume that there will typically be one VM type with the best price/performance ratio for the application.

\subsection{Application Model}
The target applications for this paper are scientific workflows that can be modeled as Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs).

We assume that we have runtime estimates for each task in the workflow.

Currently we do not consider data sizes, but rather assume that data is stored in a shared cloud storage system such as Amazon S3 and that data transfer times are included in task runtime estimates. Further, data transfer times are equal across the VMs.

An ensemble consists of several related workflows. Each workflow is given a priority.

The goal is to complete as many workflows as possible given a budget and a deadline.

\section{Algorithms}

\subsection{Static Provisioning Dynamic Scheduling (SPDS)}

This is the simplest strategy based on static provisioning of resources and
on-line scheduling of workflow tasks. Given the budget $B$ and deadline $d$
together with the hourly price $p$ of a VM it is possible to compute the number
of VMs $N_{VM}$ to provision so that they consume the whole budget between the
deadline. 

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:static-plan}
N_{VM} = \lceil B / d / p \rceil
\end{equation}

Although simple, such provisioning plan has the advantage that it
minimizes the number of provisioning and deprovisioning requests.
Once the resources are provisioned, the tasks are scheduled to VMs using dynamic
priority-based algorithm shown in Algorithm~\ref{alg:ds}. 

% This is an example of how we can do algorithms
\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Priority-based scheduling}
\label{alg:ds}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\Procedure{schedule}{}
    \State $Q\gets set\ of\ released\ tasks$
    \State $P\gets empty\ priority\ queue$
    \While{$Q \neq \emptyset$}
    	\For{$task\ t\in Q$}
    		\State \Call{Insert}{$t,P$} 
    	\EndFor
    	\While{$FreeVMs \neq \emptyset \wedge P \neq \emptyset $}
    		\State $VM\gets$ \Call{SelectRandom}{$FreeVMs$}
    		\State $t\gets$ \Call{Pop}{$P$}
    		\State \Call{Submit}{$t,VM$}
    	\EndWhile
    	\State \Call{Wait}{$task\ finished$}
    	\State \Call{Update}{$Q$}
    \EndWhile
\EndProcedure
\end{algorithmic} 
\end{algorithm}

Initially all the
released tasks from all the workflows are submitted to the queue $Q$. Then, they
are inserted into priority queue $P$ based on the priority of workflows. If
there are free VMs available, the tasks from the priority queue are submitted to
the randomly choosen VMs. The process is repeated each time a task finishes.
Using the priority queue guarantees that tasks from lower priority workflows are
always submitted later than the higher priority ones and that the lower priority
tasks can occupy idle VMs. However, as there is no preemption, long-running
low-priority tasks may delay execution of high-priority tasks when such ones
become ready. Fig.~\ref{fig:spss-example} shows the example plan generated using
SPSS algorithm.

 by colors depending on the workflow. }

\subsection{Dynamic Provisioning Dynamic Scheduling (DPDS)}



\subsection{Workflow-Aware DPDS (WA-DPDS)}

\subsection{Static Provisioning Static Scheduling (SPSS)}

We assume that the workflows are very wide such that the critical path of any given workflow is much less than the deadline.

The approach is to schedule each workflow in the ensemble in priority order, rejecting any workflows that cannot be completed by the deadline or that cause the cost of the plan to exceed the budget. Once the plan is complete, then the workflows are executed according to the plan.

\begin{algorithm}

\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\Require $W$: workflow ensemble; $b$: budget; $d$: deadline
\Ensure Schedule as much of $W$ as possible given $b$ and $d$

        \State $P^\prime \gets$\ \Call{PlanDAG}{$w,P,d$}
        \If{$P^\prime\ is\ a\ valid\ plan$}
            \If{$Cost(P^\prime) \le b$}
                \State $P\gets\ P^\prime$ \Comment{Accept new plan}
                \State $A \gets A\ +\ w$ \Comment{Admit w}
            \EndIf
        \EndIf
    \EndFor
    \State \textbf{return} $P,A$

    \State \Call{DeadlineDistribution}{w,d}
    \For{$t\ in\ w\ sorted\ by\ Deadline(t)$}
        \State Choose resource r in $P^\prime$ that minimizes Cost(t)
        \If{$AFT(t,r) < Deadline(t)$}
            \State Schedule(t,r)
        \Else
            \State Provision a new resource r
            \State Schedule(t,r)
        \EndIf
    \EndFor
    \State \textbf{return} $P^\prime$

\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Deadline distribution algorithm}
\label{alg:deadlinedistribution}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]

\Ensure Assign sub-deadlines to each task in w
\Procedure{DeadlineDistribution}{$w,d$}
    \State $T \gets$ total number of tasks in $w$
    \State $R \gets$ total runtime of tasks in $w$
    \State $CP \gets$ length of critical path of $w$
    \State assign $Level(t)$ to each task $t$ in $w$
    \For{level $l\ \in w$}
        \State $Tasks(l) \gets$ number of tasks in $l$
        \State $Runtime(l) \gets$ runtime of tasks in $l$
        \State $r \gets \alpha * (Runtime(l)/R)$
        \State $t \gets (1-\alpha) * (Tasks(l)/T)$
        \State $FT(l) \gets (r + t) * (d - CP)$
    \EndFor
    \For{task $t \in w$}
        \State $LST(t) \gets \max(Deadline(p))\ for\ p \in Pred(t)$
        \State $Deadline(t) \gets LST(t) + RT(t) + FT(Level(t))$
    \EndFor
\EndProcedure
\end{algorithmic} 
\end{algorithm}

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:scaling}
FT(l) = \left[{\alpha}*\frac{T_l}{t}\right] + \left[{(1 - \alpha)}*\frac{R_l}{r} \right]
